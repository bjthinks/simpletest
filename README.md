# Simple Simple Group Order Tester

This program applies some straightforward group theory arguments to check if
each number from 2 to 10,000 could be the order of a finite simple group.
It can, for example, prove that if a simple group has order <= 200, then
it must be of order 60, 120, 144, 168, or 180.
